Mapsforge_iOS
=============

This is an updated fork of initial Mapsforge_iOS project created by Medved Nick (medvednick@yandex.ru).

The project has been updated to compile with 64 bit environment (arm64).

NOTE if you are an Apple developer: Beginning on February 1, 2015 new iOS apps submitted to the App Store must include 64-bit support and be built with the iOS 8 SDK

=============

This is Objective-C analog for some part of Mapsforge library for Android, which you can find there: http://code.google.com/p/mapsforge/ 

MapsforgeReader allows iOS applications to read compact .map files with vector maps. There is an example, which should be working without any settings.

This example is a simple view controller with modified RouteMe mapView on it. It consists of sub projects, and these ones have been changed or made by me:

1. MapsforgeReader. It parses .map file into primitives. This is almost copy-paste from Android's sources, but in obj-c, converted by me with help of java2objc tool (http://code.google.com/p/java2objc/). Note: the way to improve parser is to use j2objc (https://code.google.com/p/j2objc/) instead.

2. OpenStreetPad. This is project from here https://github.com/beelsebob/OpenStreetPad with some changes. I took CoreGraphics renderer from that project.

3. RouteMe. I made some changes like asynchronous tile loading and changing data source and renderer to my ones.

Another sub projects like Proj4 or sqlite were not changed, but I added them to make example project run without additional job.

Note: the last changes of Mapsforge_iOS  had beed done in summer 2012, and some things can be changed.
